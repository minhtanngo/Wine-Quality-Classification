# Wine-Quality-Classification

This is a small project from Introduction to Data Science unit at Swinburne University of Technology. I have built Logistic Regression and RandomForestRegressor model with accuracy of 96% for RandomForestRegressor model. 

Red Wine Quality Project. A practice dataset for regression or classification modeling.


The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

This dataset is available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
